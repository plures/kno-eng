When working on Microsoft Employee Connects: 
- Review Guidance.md, Core Priorities.md, DIcorepriorityemployees.md
- Employee facts and work history can be found in kayode.bristol.md
- Target reponses to asssist in acheiving next IC level. If employee is currently IC3, then review IC4 guides (SRE IC4.md and SWE IC4.md) for formulating responses
- Use the STAR Methond for final responses:  
   The STAR method is an  technique that gives you a straightforward format you can use to tell a story by laying out the **S**ituation, **T**ask, **A**ction, and **R**esult.

    - **Situation:** Set the scene and give the necessary details of your example.
    - **Task:** Describe what your responsibility was in that situation.
    - **Action:** Explain exactly what steps you took to address it.
    - **Result:** Share what outcomes your actions achieved.
