## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Current Data Flow
```
VSCode Extension → NoteManager → Mock GUN.js → Local Storage
                ↓
            AutoMemoryManager → Storage Factory → Multiple Backends
```

### Target Data Flow (After GUN.js Integration)
```
VSCode Extension → NoteManager → Real GUN.js → P2P Network
                ↓
            AutoMemoryManager → Storage Factory → GUN.js + Local Cache
                ↓
            AI Manager → Local LLM → Enhanced Features
```

### Storage Strategy
- **Local Cache**: Fast access to frequently used notes
- **GUN.js Storage**: P2P synchronization and sharing
- **Auto Memory Storage**: Pattern learning and error prevention
- **Backup**: JSON export/import for data portability

## 🚨 Known Issues and Risks

### Technical Risks
1. **GUN.js Integration Complexity**: Mock implementation in place, real integration needed
2. **Performance with Large Datasets**: Caching implemented, needs testing with real data
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Architecture supports this, needs testing

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Integration**: Start with simple GUN.js operations, gradually add complexity
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement metrics and monitoring from the start
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Create test suite covering all platforms and scenarios
