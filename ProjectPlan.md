Local-First AI Personal Knowledge Base: Development Roadmap Overview and Guiding
Principles Open Source & Local-First: Use only open-source technologies. The
system runs fully on user devices for data ownership and longevity – it remains
usable offline and under user control even if the original developers or servers
disappear [Hacker News discussion on local-first software](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21581444). All core components (database, AI models, UI
libraries) will be self-hostable to avoid cloud lock-in. Iterative, Layered
Development: Develop in phases, starting with a minimal MVP focusing on core
note-taking features. Each phase adds a "layer" of functionality (e.g., basic
notes → AI assistance → sync → advanced logic → self-improvement), refactoring
as needed. This ensures quick initial delivery and continuous improvement with
manageable complexity at each step. Self-Hostable and Self-Developing: The
application is installed locally (no mandatory cloud services). It will
eventually assist in its own development – for example, by using the integrated
AI to suggest code improvements or by managing its upgrade plans within the note
base. The initial design will include tools (like an AI coding assistant or
planning agent) so the system can help build and refine future versions of
itself. Hybrid AI (Local & Remote): Incorporate both open-source local Large
Language Models (LLMs) and optional remote LLM services. For offline or
privacy-sensitive tasks, rely on local models (via frameworks like Ollama or LM
Studio). Ollama is a simple open-source tool for running LLMs locally
[Ollama documentation](https://ollama.ai/docs), while LM Studio provides a user-friendly UI to run a variety of
open models [LM Studio overview](https://lmstudio.ai). For heavier tasks or superior quality, allow
integration with closed-source APIs (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, etc.) as an
optional feature. This hybrid approach balances privacy and capability: default
to local AI for everyday use, and fall back to cloud AI when explicitly needed
(with user API keys). Peer-to-Peer Graph Database Backbone: Use GUN.js (an
open-source, decentralized graph database) as the core data layer for storing
notes and syncing them across devices. GUN operates on a peer-to-peer network,
enabling real-time sync without a central server [Volodymyr Pavlyshyn's guide to GUN](https://volodymyrpavlyshyn.medium.com/building-a-decentralized-real-time-collaborative-whiteboard-with-gun-js-76c0fe4458c5).
It's offline-first: users can create and edit notes offline, and data will
seamlessly sync across nodes once back online [GUN.js offline capabilities](https://volodymyrpavlyshyn.medium.com/offline-first-apps-an-introduction-to-gun-js-9564fe7e7caf).
GUN's graph model naturally represents a knowledge base with notes and
relationships, and its CRDT conflict resolution will merge changes from multiple
devices. We plan to fork and customize GUN in later phases – initially using it
out-of-the-box for rapid development, then modifying or rewriting parts
(potentially in Rust) to improve performance, add features (like built-in vector
indexing), and tailor it specifically for our knowledge base needs. Finite State
Machine Orchestration: Design core interactions as finite state machines. Each
complex operation (e.g. fetching context for an AI query, or a multi-step user
command) will be modeled as a sequence of states and transitions. This
structured approach "grounds" the workflow and keeps the AI's process
transparent and deterministic [StateFlow: LLM Tool Use Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16582). For example, an AI-assisted workflow
might have states like "User Query Received" → "Search Notes" → "Compose Answer"
→ "Await Feedback". Using an FSM library (such as XState in TypeScript) or
custom state charts ensures that even as we integrate LLMs, the system's
behavior is not entirely free-form: it will follow defined paths, handle errors
(transitions to failure states), and make the overall AI agent behavior more
reliable. Research like StateFlow demonstrates that modeling LLM tool use as
state machines provides clear tracking of progress and more controlled
decision-making [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629). We will apply this principle from early development
(for simple tasks) and expand it for complex multi-agent orchestration in later
phases. Core Tech Stack: Build the app with a modern, cross-platform stack.
TypeScript/JavaScript will be used for most code (ensuring type safety and vast
library support). The UI will be built with Svelte, a lightweight reactive
framework, to create a desktop note-taking interface that is fast and modular.
We'll leverage Markdown as the primary note format (for familiarity and
portability), with support for Mermaid diagrams in notes (so users can include
flowcharts/UML diagrams in their markdown). Development will be done in Visual
Studio Code, and we envision a VS Code extension in the future to let developers
interact with the knowledge base from their IDE (inspired by tools like Foam
which build a knowledge base on VS Code [Foam Documentation](https://github.com/foambubble/foam)). For packaging the desktop
app on Windows/Linux, we will use either Electron or Tauri. Tauri is preferred
(it uses a Rust backend with a webview UI), aligning with our use of Rust for
performance-critical components and offering a smaller footprint than Electron.
Rust will be introduced for any heavy-lifting modules – for example, low-level
text processing, a future custom database engine, or cryptographic routines for
security. Cross-Platform by Design: The initial target platform is Windows and
Linux (desktop). We will ensure the code is portable (using cross-platform
frameworks and avoiding OS-specific dependencies). After validating on those, we
will extend support to macOS (which should be straightforward if using
Electron/Tauri) and then to mobile (Android/iOS) and even IoT devices. The
offline-first, lightweight nature of the stack (Svelte and a ~9KB database
library [GUN.js Size and Performance](https://volodymyrpavlyshyn.medium.com/building-a-decentralized-real-time-collaborative-whiteboard-with-gun-js-76c0fe4458c5)) means it can potentially run on a Raspberry Pi or similar devices. Later phases will include creating a
mobile-optimized UI and possibly a headless mode for IoT or server use. Enhanced
Note-Taking Features: Even in the early UI, the note-taking experience will be
augmented with "smart" features. This includes AI-powered autocomplete or
suggestions (the system might suggest relevant references from your knowledge
base as you type), one-click research integration (e.g. select text and search
the web or academic resources, with results brought back into your notes), and
planning/organizing tools (like the ability to generate an outline or schedule
from free-form text). These will be gradually introduced: starting with simple
suggestions and expanding to proactive agents that can assist in gathering
information or managing to-do lists. The interface will remain Markdown-centric
(so users have full control of content), with additional sidebars or pop-ups for
AI-driven insights (for example, a panel that shows related notes or an
AI-generated summary of the current note). Integrated Knowledge & Reasoning
Engines: As the system evolves, we will add structured knowledge capabilities
alongside the unstructured notes. A fact store will hold atomic facts or triples
extracted from notes (or entered by the user) – effectively a knowledge graph
within the graph database. On top of this, a rules engine will let users or the
system define logical rules (e.g., "If a note is tagged #urgent and created >30
days ago, mark it for review"). We can employ a lightweight open-source rules
engine (e.g. a JSON-rules-engine library) or implement a custom one for
fine-grained control. A logic engine will handle inference; for instance, using
Prolog-like logic or a truth maintenance system to derive new facts or answer
queries strictly based on the fact store. These components will complement the
LLM – providing deterministic reasoning and enforcing constraints (the LLM might
consult the logic engine for precise info, rather than guessing). Additionally,
a tool registry will catalogue available tools/skills the AI agents can use
(such as web search, calculator, external APIs). The registry will describe each
tool's interface and permissions, and the orchestration engine (governed by
FSMs) can enable the AI to call these tools when appropriate. This modular
approach means new tools can be added over time (for example, a calendar
integration agent, or an email-sending agent) and the system's AI workflows can
grow in capability. Vectors and Embeddings: To power semantic search and context
awareness, the system will make heavy use of vector embeddings. All notes (and
potentially sub-sections of notes) will be periodically embedded into
high-dimensional vectors using an open-source model (for example, SBERT or
InstructorXL for text embeddings, running locally). These embeddings will be
stored in the graph database alongside the notes. We plan to integrate vector
search capabilities directly in our fork of GUN (since GUN is a general graph
store, we may extend it with an index or a module for similarity search). In
early iterations, we can use a simple library for vector search in memory, or
even brute-force cosine similarity on moderate data, given that personal
knowledge bases might not exceed tens of thousands of notes. Over time, this
will be optimized – potentially by integrating an ANN (approximate nearest
neighbor) algorithm in Rust, or using a client-side vector search library that
outperforms cloud vector DBs for typical sizes [USEMb.js Vector Search](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js). The goal is seamless
semantic augmentation: when you search or ask a question, the system can find
relevant information by meaning, not just keywords, all stored locally. Security
by Design (PKI & Encryption): Security is a first-class concern. We will use
public-key cryptography to secure data and communications. Each user (or device)
will have a cryptographic key pair. Data saved in the graph database can be
signed and encrypted such that only the owner (or authorized peers) can decrypt
it. GUN's built-in SEA (Security, Encryption, Authorization) module uses ECDSA
for signatures and allows field-level encryption with shared secrets. We will
leverage and later refine this. End-to-end encryption will ensure that even if
notes are synced via an untrusted relay or stored on a backup node, they remain
private [GUN.js Security Model](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21581444). Conflict resolution will happen on the client
side (thanks to CRDTs), and keys are controlled by users (no central server
holds your credentials) [GUN.js security overview](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21581444). For authentication, peers will
mutually verify identities via public keys, and actions like sharing a note with
another user (possible in future) will use key exchange to grant access. In
summary, all data at rest and in transit will be encrypted, and all code will be
open for inspection to build trust. With these principles in mind, we outline
the development in phases below. Each phase represents a milestone build of the
system, expanding its functionality while adhering to the above guidelines.
Phase 1: MVP – Core Offline Note-Taking System Goal: Deliver a basic yet
functional personal note-taking application that works offline and stores data
locally in a sync-ready format. This phase focuses on the fundamentals:
creating, editing, and organizing notes on desktop, using the P2P graph database
as storage. It establishes the project's foundation with minimal AI or complex
features – the emphasis is on local-first data handling and a usable UI. Key
Components and Features: Note Editor & Storage: Implement a Markdown editor in
Svelte for creating and editing notes. Users can create notes (stored as
markdown text, with metadata like title, tags, timestamps). The editor should
support common Markdown syntax (headings, bold/italic, code blocks, etc.) and
preview mode. We'll integrate Mermaid so that users can include diagrams in
fenced code blocks (the app can render these into SVG diagrams in the preview).
Initially, notes are stored in a local GUN instance. We instantiate a GUN
database (using IndexedDB or file storage as a local persistence layer) and save
notes as nodes in the graph (e.g., each note is an object with fields for
content, title, links, etc.). GUN's schema-less nature lets us start simple
(perhaps a top-level "notes" node that maps note IDs to note content). Even with
a single device, using GUN sets the stage for sync and real-time updates.
Milestone: Basic create/read/update/delete (CRUD) of notes, with changes
persisted and surviving app restart. Notes can be exported/imported as Markdown
files for interoperability (since we're using open formats). Graph Data Model:
Even if the UI is just a list of notes to start, underneath we use the graph
database to allow future linking and complex relationships. For MVP, we might
not expose full graph navigation, but we will store any note-to-note links
(e.g., if the user types a Wiki-style link [[NoteName]], or we have a concept of
backlinks) in the database. This way, the data model is rich from the start,
even if the initial frontend is simple. We ensure that each note has a unique ID
(could be a UUID or a hash) to act as a stable identifier in the graph. This
will be important once we have multiple devices and need to sync without
clashing IDs. Offline-First & Sync-Ready: Confirm that the app can create and
edit notes without network connectivity (which it can, since everything is local
by default). In this phase, we might not connect multiple peers yet, but we use
GUN's offline-first capability to queue any changes. By using GUN, if two
instances of the app are running (for example, on the same machine or different
machines with a manual peer connection), updates on one should propagate to the
other. We'll include a basic "sync" toggle or indicator in the UI to show
connectivity status (even if it's just to a local GUN peer for now). This will
lay the groundwork for user-controlled syncing. For now, all data stays on the
local machine unless the user explicitly connects another peer or exports data.
Security Initialization: Generate a key pair for the user on first launch (or
have them supply one/passphrase). Even if we don't fully utilize encryption yet,
having a cryptographic identity set up from day one is important. Using GUN's
user API, a user can create an account which provides a public/private key pair
(ECDSA P-256 by default). We store the private key securely (e.g., encrypted
with a passphrase if the user sets one). For MVP, we might skip complex auth
flows, but all data writes can already be signed by the user's key. This ensures
that as soon as multiple devices or multi-user scenarios are introduced, we can
verify the origin of data. It also sets the stage for encryption: e.g., we can
choose to encrypt the content field of notes even in the local DB (so that if
someone browses the raw DB they see ciphertext). Milestone: User has a
cryptographic identity and the app uses it to store at least one piece of signed
data in the DB (proving the concept). Basic UI & UX: Develop a clean desktop UI
with Svelte. The layout might include a sidebar (for a list of notes or tags), a
main editor panel, and a preview/toggle for Markdown rendering. Use Svelte's
reactivity to update the preview as the user types. Include search (simple text
search through note titles/contents) to retrieve notes – initially, this can be
a basic substring search on the loaded notes or an index built in memory. We
will not yet implement full-text indexing in the DB (that might come with
embeddings or a search library later), but we ensure the architecture allows
plugging that in. The app should feel snappy and not require any login or
internet – truly install and go. Tools & Tech Used in Phase 1: TypeScript +
Svelte for the app, GUN.js for storage, and possibly Electron (if we choose it)
or Tauri as the shell to package the app for Windows/Linux. Markdown rendering
can be done with a library like Marked or mdsvex (for Svelte). Mermaid's JS
library will render diagrams. No AI integration yet (aside from maybe preparing
a placeholder for suggestions). VS Code isn't directly in use in the app, but we
maintain the project in VS Code and ensure the code structure could later
support a VS Code extension (for example, keep logic decoupled from UI so it can
be reused in an extension context). Milestones for Phase 1: By the end of this
phase, we expect an MVP where the user can: Open the application (Windows/Linux)
and create a local profile (with keys generated behind the scenes). Create new
notes in markdown, edit them with formatting and see a preview (including any
Mermaid diagrams). Navigate a list of notes, search by keyword, and edit or
delete existing notes. Quit and restart the app to find their notes still
available (persisted in the local database). (Stretch goal) Run two instances of
the app and see updates propagate (proving the P2P sync works in a basic way).
This MVP is intentionally limited in scope – it's essentially a local
Obsidian/Notion-lite with the important distinction that it's built on a
real-time sync graph database and prepared for expansion. It provides a
foundation to iterate on. Phase 2: AI Augmentation – Smart Suggestions & Local
Assistant Goal: Introduce AI capabilities to enhance the note-taking experience.
This phase integrates language model support for features like autocomplete,
summarization, Q&A on notes, and smart content suggestions. It leverages local
LLMs for offline use and optionally allows connecting to cloud AI for more
advanced functions. The system begins to evolve from a static note store into an
intelligent personal assistant. Key Features and Enhancements: Local LLM
Integration: Bundle or integrate with an open-source LLM to run on the user's
machine. We will start with smaller models (to ensure they run on typical
hardware). Tools like Ollama or LM Studio can manage model downloads and provide
a local API. For example, we could run a 7B-13B parameter model (such as Llama 2
or GPT4All-J) locally. The note app will include a backend service (or utilize
Ollama's) to query the model. We might expose a simple chat interface within the
app where the user can ask questions or request a rewrite of selected text.
Initially, keep prompts simple (no complex multi-agent chain yet). Milestone:
The user can highlight text in a note and invoke "Summarize" or "Rephrase", and
the local AI will output the result into the UI. Another example: the user can
ask "What did I note about X last week?" and the system can search notes (see
embeddings below) and feed the content to the LLM to answer. Optional Remote AI:
Provide settings to configure API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. If the user
opts in, certain AI features can be powered by remote models (for better
accuracy on complex tasks). For instance, a "Research Answer" feature might use
GPT-4 to get a high-quality answer that references the user's notes combined
with external knowledge. All such calls will be orchestrated to mix local data
with the prompt (ensuring no private data is sent out unless user allows). A
clear indicator will show when a cloud service is being used. This dual setup
acknowledges that local models might be slower or less capable for some time, so
the user isn't limited by them if they need more power. Embeddings & Semantic
Search: Implement the first version of semantic search. We introduce an
embedding generator (could be a small SentenceTransformer or use the same local
LLM if it can produce embeddings). Each note (or even each paragraph) gets an
embedding vector stored in the database. For MVP, we might use a simple
approach: whenever a note is saved, compute its embedding (either via a local
model or calling an open API like OpenAI's embedding endpoint, depending on
what's available – though we stick to open source if possible, maybe using a
model like InstructorXL locally). Store the embedding in a separate part of the
GUN graph (for example, noteID -> embedding). To perform a semantic search, we
compute the query embedding and do a cosine similarity against all stored
vectors. Since the data volume is likely manageable, this brute-force method is
fine initially. If performance is an issue, we can integrate a vector search
library (there are client-side libraries that handle efficient ANN search). The
result is that the user can search by meaning: e.g. searching "project timeline"
will find a note about scheduling even if it doesn't contain those exact words.
Also, when asking the AI a question, we can retrieve the top-N similar notes and
include them in the LLM prompt (this is the start of a retrieval augmented
generation approach). Milestone: A "Search (AI)" function that returns relevant
notes by concept, and an "Ask the KB" function where the AI answers using the
content of notes (with references). AI-Assisted Note Taking: Add features where
the AI proactively helps during note editing. For example, as the user types,
the system could suggest autocompletions (leveraging the LLM to continue the
sentence or provide a list when a bullet is started). Or if the user types
"Todo: ...", the app could suggest steps or subtasks. These suggestions can be
via a unobtrusive UI element (like a faint suggestion text or a pop-up list the
user can accept). We will use the local LLM for this to keep it real-time and
privacy-preserving. Another feature: Smart Links – when a note mentions a
concept that exists in another note, the system could hint "You have related
notes on [Concept]." This would use the embeddings or even direct string
matching to detect related content. The user could then one-click insert a link
to that note or open it. This makes the knowledge base feel interconnected
intelligently. Initial FSM Orchestration: Although full orchestration comes in
Phase 4, we start applying FSM principles in how we implement these AI features.
For instance, the "Ask the KB" operation can be modeled as: State 1: "Query
received" → State 2: "Retrieve relevant notes (embedding search)" → State 3:
"Compose prompt with notes and user question" → State 4: "LLM generates answer"
→ State 5: "Display answer". We can implement this as a simple hardcoded
sequence now, but framing it as a state machine will make it easier to extend
(e.g., we could add a state to verify the answer or to optionally go out to the
web in future). We might incorporate a library like XState to manage these
flows. By the end of Phase 2, the user interactions with AI should appear smooth
and single-step, but internally we have a structured flow that we can expand
later. UI Enhancements for AI: Update the interface to accommodate the new AI
features. This might include an AI toolbar or menu with actions like "Ask a
question", "Summarize note", "Continue writing". Perhaps a sidebar for an AI
chat where the context is the user's notes. Also, we should display sources when
the AI uses notes (e.g., if it answers with info from Note A and B, it should
list those as references, increasing transparency). Under the hood, we maintain
a log of AI interactions in the database (this could be saved as special
"conversation" notes or as a separate log store). Keeping a history means the
knowledge base contains the dialogues and can learn from them (or the user can
refer back). Security-wise, ensure that if any remote calls are made, the user
is warned and possibly the content is sanitized or user-approved to avoid
accidental leakage of sensitive info. Tools & Tech Used in Phase 2: This phase
brings in AI/ML tooling. We will integrate with LLM runtimes: possibly using the
Ollama CLI by calling it from our app (Ollama can run models and we send it
prompts) or using LM Studio's local server mode. Alternatively, we can
incorporate a library like GPT4All or llama.cpp directly, but that might involve
bundling model weights which could bloat the app. Using an external but local
service (Ollama/LM Studio) decouples the model management. For embeddings, if
using a smaller transformer, we could use tensorflow.js or ONNX Runtime in the
app to compute embeddings on the fly. If that's too slow, we might initially
call an external API for embeddings with user permission, then later swap to
local once we integrate a faster local solution. The FSM could use XState (an
npm package) to define state charts for tasks. We also might start using OpenAI
function calling or tools concept but locally – essentially preparing how the
LLM might call our tool functions (like search). But we can keep it simple: we
manually orchestrate tool use rather than letting the LLM freely decide.
Milestones for Phase 2: Now the system is not just a static notebook, but an
intelligent assistant. By the end of this phase: The user can invoke AI commands
on their notes without leaving the app (e.g., "summarize this meeting notes"
yields a summary right in place). The user can ask the system questions and get
answers that cite which notes were used (demonstrating retrieval + LLM reasoning
over personal data). The app works fully offline for these features using a
local model (assuming a model is installed). If no local model is present or too
slow, the user has the option to plug in an API key and use a remote model for
better performance – this path should also be tested. The underlying
architecture now has the beginnings of an AI agent (albeit a single-step one) –
we have components for searching notes, calling an LLM, etc., coordinated in a
controlled manner. We likely have a simple orchestration module coded that we'll
expand later. User feedback on this phase will be crucial – we will ensure the
system's suggestions are useful but not intrusive, and that the user can always
choose when to use AI (maintaining a feeling of control and privacy). At this
stage, the product is a knowledge base with a built-in assistant, all running
locally. Next, we will tackle synchronization across devices and multi-user
scenarios, building on the solid base of offline functionality and AI smarts.
Phase 3: Distributed Sync – Multi-Device and Collaboration Goal: Enable robust
data synchronization across multiple devices (and eventually multiple users)
while maintaining offline-first operation. This phase turns the app from a
single-node system into a distributed network of peers that share the knowledge
base. It hardens the security model with encryption/authentication now that data
may traverse networks. We also improve reliability and conflict resolution so
the knowledge base remains consistent across peers. Key Features and Tasks:
Peer-to-Peer Sync Rollout: Activate GUN's full peer-to-peer capabilities. In
Phase 1, we used GUN locally; now we allow the app to connect to other instances
of itself. Implement a "Device Sync" interface where a user can add a new device
to their mesh. This can be done by sharing a peer URL or using a secret for
initialization. For example, the app can start a GUN relay server in the
background on one device, and another device can connect to it if on the same
network (using IP or a relay). We might also provide a simple cloudless relay
option: e.g., use WebRTC or local network discovery to connect two devices
directly. GUN supports WebRTC for peer discovery in browsers; in an
Electron/Tauri setting, we might need to include a relay server or allow user to
input an address. The key is that no central server is required – users can
self-host a relay or use one of the public GUN relays as a fallback (with data
encrypted). Once connected, the entire graph (or relevant subset) should sync.
This means if you take notes on a laptop, they appear on your PC seconds later,
and vice versa, even if both were offline and meet later (they'll merge when
connected). We will test conflict resolution by editing the same note on two
devices offline and then syncing – thanks to GUN's CRDT approach, it will do a
last-write-wins merge by default [Jared Forsyth's CRDT Explanation](https://jaredforsyth.com/posts/confluence-crdt-real-time-editing/). We need to ensure our data
model identifies conflicts per field appropriately (e.g., two different edits to
different parts of a note should merge, not overwrite each other – perhaps we'll
store note content as chunks or use GUN's lexical CRDT). Milestone: Two devices
can sync a set of notes bi-directionally without data loss or duplication, and
the process is user-friendly. End-to-End Encryption & Access Control: Now that
data leaves the local device, we enforce encryption. Using the key pairs
generated earlier, implement encryption for data in transit. GUN can encrypt
data at the field level using shared secrets derived from users' keys. If this
is a single-user multi-device scenario, the same user's identity on both devices
can decrypt the data. We might require the user to log in on the second device
with their key (perhaps by scanning a QR code from device 1 that encodes the
private key encrypted with a passphrase, or by using a cloud drive to transfer
an encrypted backup). Once both devices have the same user's private key, they
can read each other's notes. Ensure that any relay or intermediary cannot read
the content [GUN.js security overview](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21581444). We also sign all updates, so unauthorized
devices can't inject false data. This security model might be extended to
multi-user (sharing notes) but for now, assume one personal user with multiple
devices. The keys also serve as the device's identity on the network,
authenticating their writes. Collaboration (Future-proofing): Although true
multi-user support might be later, design the sync and data model in Phase 3 to
not preclude it. Possibly allow basic sharing: e.g., the user could invite a
second identity (friend or coworker) to collaborate on a subset of notes. This
would involve key exchange (friend's public key is given access to decrypt a
specific subset). While we might not implement full UI for sharing in this
phase, thinking ahead will make adding it easier. Focus on device
interoperability now, but keep the concept of user identity abstract enough that
adding more identities isn't a huge refactor. Improved Data Handling and
Refactoring: With sync working, we might refactor how data is structured in the
graph for efficiency. For example, if notes are very large, GUN's performance
might suffer; we could choose to split note content by paragraphs or use a
different data schema. We might also introduce indices in the data (like a
sorted list of note IDs for quick retrieval, or maintaining a separate title->ID
map for search). These indices themselves are stored in the graph and thus sync
across devices. It's an opportunity to clean up technical debt from MVP now that
the system is more complex. We also consider storage concerns: GUN by default
persists in the browser storage; we ensure on desktop it persists to a durable
location. Provide backup options like exporting the entire graph to a file
(which would be encrypted JSON) for user peace of mind. Cross-Platform Testing:
At this point, ensure the app runs on Windows and Linux smoothly in sync
scenarios. We can also test on a Mac (even if unofficially) because adding Mac
support likely just means packaging and minor fixes. Possibly release a Mac
build as well if trivial. The broader the device coverage now, the more
confident we are in the P2P system's robustness. If using Tauri, test
codesigning on Mac; if Electron, ensure any native modules (for encryption or
such) build on Mac. Performance and Optimization: With real-time sync and
possibly a lot of data flowing, profile the app. Optimize rendering for large
notes or large number of notes (maybe implement virtual scrolling in lists,
etc.). If GUN's performance shows limits, note them for Phase 5 (where we might
replace it). We may introduce a lightweight caching layer or in-memory mirror of
the database to speed up read operations in the app. User Experience for Sync:
Add UI elements to manage sync: show when last synced, show connected peers or
devices, allow the user to disconnect a device, etc. Possibly integrate conflict
resolution feedback – although CRDT means few hard conflicts, if they do occur
(like if a note was edited in the exact same property on both sides), the app
could highlight the merged result and let the user review edit history. We can
store a simple edit log or use GUN's state info to offer a "history" feature per
note (not full version control yet, but at least last edit timestamp per peer).
Tools & Tech in Phase 3: Mostly extending what we have. We might use WebRTC via
GUN (so include the necessary adapters). If a dedicated relay server is needed
for internet traversal, we can either instruct users how to run a GUN relay
(which is essentially a small Node.js server) or for convenience use a community
relay in the interim (since data is E2E encrypted, using a public relay is
acceptable from a privacy standpoint). For cryptography, ensure usage of robust
libraries – likely rely on GUN's SEA which uses WebCrypto or similar for ECDSA
and AES under the hood, but double-check its security. Possibly introduce Rust
here if we want to implement any crypto or compression in Rust for speed (Tauri
could call into that). Testing frameworks to simulate multi-peer might be used
(for example, spawn two instances in integration tests). Milestones for Phase 3:
By the end of this phase: A user with two devices (say a desktop and a laptop)
can use the app on both and keep their knowledge base in sync in near real-time.
Edits on one appear on the other (when both online), and if offline, they merge
next time they connect. All note data syncing between devices is end-to-end
encrypted. We can verify (perhaps by attempting to intercept data or checking
the relay) that only ciphertext is traveling over the wire. The app supports at
least a basic multi-user scenario, even if it's just prepared (for instance, two
different users with different keys could technically share a note by exchanging
public keys and data – though a friendly UI for this could be minimal or
experimental). The system remains stable and efficient with a growing number of
notes. We should be able to handle a few thousand notes without significant
slowdown, and sync overhead should be manageable (thanks to GUN's graph diff
sync). Documentation and guides likely updated: how to set up sync, how security
works, etc., since by now early adopters could be using it across their devices.
At this point, the system is a distributed, encrypted personal knowledge base
with built-in AI assistance. Next, we will deepen the intelligence by adding
rule-based reasoning, tool usage, and more autonomous agent behavior. Phase 4:
Advanced Intelligence – Rules Engine, Logic, and Orchestration Goal: Evolve the
system's intelligence beyond just LLM responses by incorporating formal
reasoning, automation rules, and more complex orchestration of tasks. In this
phase, the personal knowledge base becomes a personal intelligent agent
platform. It can not only respond to direct prompts, but also trigger actions,
maintain knowledge consistency, and perform multi-step tool-using workflows on
behalf of the user. We introduce the remaining components: a rules engine, logic
inference, a full-fledged orchestration engine coordinating LLMs and tools
(using FSMs), and a registry of capabilities the system (or its AI) can use. Key
Additions and Changes: Rules Engine for Automation: Integrate a rules engine
that can execute user-defined or system-defined rules on the data. For instance,
a user might set up: "If a note contains '#task' and a date, and today is past
that date, mark it as overdue." The rules engine would periodically (or on data
change) evaluate conditions on the graph (notes and their attributes) and
perform actions (like update a field, send a notification, or call an AI
function). We can use a JSON-based rules definition (similar to
json-rules-engine library) which supports logical conditions (AND/OR,
comparisons). The engine can run in the background (maybe on an interval or
triggered by specific events in the DB). This brings a level of IFTTT-like
automation to the PKB. We'll ensure rules themselves are stored in the knowledge
base (so they sync across devices and can be edited like notes). Possibly,
present a simple UI for creating rules (or require advanced users to write them
in JSON/YAML at first). Milestone: At least one useful automation works – e.g.,
automated tagging, reminders, or consistency checks. Logic/Fact Engine: Build a
fact store within the graph to hold structured knowledge. This could be triples
(Subject–Predicate–Object) extracted from notes or added manually. For example,
if the user has a note "John is Alice's brother", the system can translate that
to a triple (John, sibling, Alice) in the fact store. Using a logic engine (even
a basic one), the system can then answer queries like "Who are Alice's
relatives?" or deduce new facts ("if sibling -> share parent"). We might
integrate a Prolog engine (there are Prolog implementations in JS, or we could
use a mini one in Rust via WASM) or use a forward-chaining engine. The purpose
is to empower the system to do precise reasoning that LLMs are not reliable at
(like math, logical puzzles, enforcing constraints). Initially, scope this to a
small domain – perhaps the user can query simple facts ("what projects involve
Bob?" if facts of who works on what are stored). The LLM can be used to parse
user queries into formal logic queries as needed. This combination of LLM +
logic engine is powerful: the LLM can interpret and converse, but the logic
engine ensures correctness on structured queries. We ensure that the logic
engine can also act as a tool in the orchestration engine (the LLM can decide to
invoke it for certain questions). Tool Capability Registry: Formalize how the AI
can use tools. We create a registry (perhaps a JSON or a part of the graph
database) that lists all "actions" the AI agent can perform, along with how to
invoke them. Tools can include: search the web, query the fact store, use the
rules engine to schedule something, send an email (if we allow external
actions), or call an external API. Each tool entry might have a name, a
description (for LLM to understand when to use it), input format, and a function
binding in the code. We then implement the logic for each tool. For example, a
"WebSearch" tool might call a search engine API or scrape results; a "SendEmail"
tool might interface with the user's SMTP or other services. In this phase, we
might keep most tools in a safe, read-only category (to avoid the agent doing
anything unwanted). But having the registry structured means the orchestration
engine/LLM can plan sequences like: "User asked to plan a trip – I have tools:
SearchFlights, SearchHotels, etc., I can use them in sequence." We make sure
adding a new tool (in future) is as simple as adding a new entry and
implementing its function, without altering the core logic. FSM-based
Orchestration Engine: Expand the orchestration from simple state flows (Phase 2)
into a robust Orchestration Engine that can handle multi-step tasks and
multi-agent scenarios. We design state machine templates for common workflows.
For instance, a "Research Task" state machine: State: Start -> Search (if query
not answerable from notes) -> Analyze Results -> Draft Answer -> Verify (maybe
cross-check facts) -> Present Answer. Each state might involve calling an LLM
with a certain prompt or using a tool. By now, we likely incorporate a library
or our own framework to manage these FSMs declaratively. The engine should
support concurrency (multiple tasks could be active, though we queue or manage
resources) and monitoring (we can have a debug view of the state machine for a
task). This is where the system's "multi-agent" aspect matures: we might not
launch multiple independent agents, but rather treat each complex user request
or background task as an agent with a defined process. We could also allow some
persistent agents – e.g., an agent that watches for certain triggers (like a
monitoring agent that watches incoming data and raises alerts, implemented as an
FSM that loops waiting for conditions). Milestone: The system can execute a
multi-step tool-using task autonomously. For example, the user could say "Gather
information on topic X and prepare a summary note." The orchestrator would: call
web search tool -> get results -> feed to LLM to summarize -> create a new note
with the summary and source links. Achieving this showcases the orchestrator,
tool registry, and LLM working in concert. Enhanced AI Planning: With tools and
FSM in place, the LLM's role shifts to a planner within those constraints. We
might implement a form of the ReAct or Chain-of-Thought strategy where the LLM,
when faced with a request, can generate a "plan" (sequence of steps using tools)
which the FSM engine will then execute step by step. Because we have the FSM
framework, the LLM's plan can be validated against allowed transitions. This
ensures the agent doesn't go off-script. We should test scenarios and perhaps
have a sandbox mode for the agent to not perform actual external actions without
confirmation (for safety). Essentially, the agent now can do things proactively
for the user, not just answer questions. User Interface & Experience: Present
these advanced features in a user-friendly way. Perhaps introduce a dashboard or
console where the user can see what automated agents or rules are running. They
might see notifications like "Rule triggered: Daily summary generated" or "Agent
completed task: Trip Planning". The user should be able to review and approve
important actions. For instance, if the agent wants to send data outside (like
an email or a web post), the app should request user confirmation. Additionally,
provide a UI to manage the rules (edit/enable/disable) and to view the knowledge
graph (by now, with notes, links, and facts, a graph visualization tool is
valuable – maybe integrate a D3.js or Cytoscape view of the knowledge graph,
similar to Foam/Obsidian's graph view). This helps users trust and understand
the system's internal knowledge. Refinement and Hardening: With so many
components, we perform refactoring and improvement passes. Possibly address the
database's performance by now if needed – for example, implement that custom
fork of GUN if we haven't yet: stripping unused parts, integrating a Rust
backend for heavy operations (via WASM or calling native code for things like
vector math or large data merges). We also thoroughly test security in
multi-agent context: ensure that an AI agent cannot accidentally leak data it
shouldn't (for example, if a prompt goes to a remote LLM, we sanitize any
private info unless intended). We likely add more test cases for the rules and
logic engines to ensure reliability (these are deterministic, so easier to test
than the stochastic LLM). Tools & Tech in Phase 4: Introduction of additional
libraries: possibly a Prolog engine (e.g., tau-prolog in JS) or a logic
programming library for the fact store. A rules engine like json-rules-engine
(Node) or writing custom rules interpreter. The orchestration engine might be
our extended use of XState or a custom state management system tuned for tool
calling (there are frameworks emerging, but we might keep ours tailored). We'll
also rely on our vector search more – possibly integrating an optimized HNSW
index in Rust for faster semantic searches if needed (since by now the knowledge
base could be larger). Continue to use Svelte for UI additions (like the graph
view or dashboards). Milestones for Phase 4: By the end of this phase, the
system should demonstrate capabilities such as: Automated knowledge management:
e.g., the system auto-tags or moves notes based on rules (without user manual
work), and can notify the user of certain conditions (a rule for "stale tasks"
might prompt the user). Logical querying: The user can ask a factual question
(that requires deduction, not just retrieval) and the system uses its structured
knowledge to answer correctly (possibly explaining the reasoning). Tool use and
multi-step tasks: The AI can use at least one non-trivial tool in an automated
way. For example, "What's the weather and schedule a reminder if it's going to
rain tomorrow" – the system uses a weather API tool and then creates a note or
reminder via rules. This indicates the agent can sense, think, and act in the
user's world to some extent. Visibility and control: The user has interfaces to
inspect the knowledge graph and the agent's decision process (e.g., a log or
visualization of the FSM steps taken for a task). This builds trust that the AI
is doing what is expected and allows debugging any odd behavior. Stability and
performance: Despite adding more layers, the system remains responsive on a
typical machine. We should have done performance tuning to achieve this (like
offloading heavy tasks to background threads or the Rust side, so the UI stays
smooth). By now, we have a full-fledged intelligent knowledge base that's far
more than a note-taking app – it's a personal assistant platform, running
locally with user-owned data. The final phase will focus on the system's ability
to sustain and improve itself and broaden its reach to other platforms. Phase 5:
Self-Improvement and Expansion (Self-Developing System) Goal: In the final
phase, make the system self-developing to the extent possible, and prepare to
extend beyond desktop. "Self-developing" means the system can assist developers
(or power users) in modifying and improving it. We leverage the AI capabilities
within the system to analyze its own code, suggest changes, and even generate
new modules. Additionally, we wrap up cross-platform support (mobile and IoT)
and prepare for broader deployment. Key Objectives and Features: AI-Assisted
Development: Integrate the development workflow into the knowledge base itself.
For example, the system's documentation and roadmap (perhaps this very plan) can
live as notes within the app. An AI agent (with access to the code repository
and these notes) can help generate tasks or even code. We might create an Agent
Developer persona in the system: it could answer questions about the code
("Which module handles sync?") by having the codebase indexed in the knowledge
base (embedding the source files for semantic search). It could also review code
for issues or write boilerplate for new features. Technically, this involves
feeding the system's own source code into the vector database and maybe setting
up a special context for the LLM that includes coding knowledge (maybe use a
code-specialized model if available locally, or use OpenAI Codex via API if
allowed). The orchestration engine can run a "development FSM" where, say, a
user files a feature request (as a note), the agent breaks it into tasks,
perhaps even drafts code changes, and waits for the developer to approve or
tweak. While full autonomous coding is ambitious, even partial assistance can
speed up development and ensure the knowledge base is always up-to-date with
design decisions. Milestone: The system can process a prompt like "Update the UI
to support dark mode" by outputting a suggested code diff or at least guiding
the developer to the relevant files and a plan of changes. This demonstrates
closing the loop: the tool is improving itself. Plugin Architecture: Make the
system extensible by users. This includes perhaps a plugin system where users
can add new tools or UI modules. For instance, a user might want to add a
calendar integration – rather than we hardcoding it, we provide a way to write a
plugin (in TypeScript) that the app can load. This requires sandboxing for
security (maybe using Web Workers or if we have a scripting engine). Since
everything is open source, advanced users could also directly fork/modify, but a
plugin system lowers the barrier to customization. The agent/tool registry
concept from Phase 4 supports this: a plugin could register new tools and
states. The rules engine and FSM orchestration should be able to incorporate new
states or actions from plugins. In essence, Phase 5 is about ensuring the
architecture is modular and documented enough that the community can contribute
and the system can grow organically beyond the core team. Cross-Platform
Clients: Develop mobile and web/IoT access. For mobile, we might create a
slimmed-down version of the app (perhaps using a cross-platform framework again,
or even a React Native/Flutter app that connects to the same GUN database).
Alternatively, since our core is P2P, a mobile app can be mostly a client that
syncs with the user's network – possibly the same codebase with Svelte can be
wrapped with Cordova/Capacitor for mobile. We will need to adapt the UI for
small screens and touch. Focus on critical features for mobile (quick capture of
notes, viewing notes, basic AI Q&A). Heavy tasks can be delegated to a desktop
peer if needed (e.g., the phone could query the desktop to use a large model
there). For IoT, maybe consider a headless mode where the app can run on a
Raspberry Pi as a personal server that keeps the DB online 24/7 or interfaces
with sensors (like log data from IoT sensors into the knowledge base, which the
AI could analyze). While full IoT integration is optional, demonstrating the
system running on lightweight hardware (e.g., a Pi hosting the knowledge base
that you then connect to from various clients) would prove the flexibility of
the platform. Fork GUN (if not done) / Database Refinement: If we haven't
replaced GUN yet, evaluate if it's needed. Perhaps by now we have identified
limitations (maybe performance at scale, or difficulty integrating vectors, or
certain platform issues). If yes, this phase we implement the custom database
engine, likely in Rust for efficiency. The new engine would adhere to the same
data model and protocols so it can seamlessly replace GUN underneath (the rest
of the app shouldn't need to change much). It would handle P2P sync, CRDT
merging, and possibly have built-in full-text and vector indexing. This is a
major undertaking, so it would only happen if truly justified. Alternatively, we
might continue with the GUN fork but significantly tune it (strip out unused
features, tweak its internals) to ensure it meets our needs. The outcome is a
more maintainable and possibly faster core for data storage, controlled entirely
by our project. Security Audit and Hardening: With self-development and plugins,
security is even more crucial. Conduct a thorough audit of the security
architecture. This includes verifying the cryptographic implementations (maybe
using external audit tools or libraries), ensuring that adding plugins cannot
compromise the core (maybe require them to be signed by the user's key). We can
introduce authentication and authorization layers for multi-user: e.g., if in
future a user shares a subset of their KB with a friend, we need a way to
enforce that only certain data is replicated to that friend, etc. Document best
practices for users (like safeguarding their private key, etc.). Possibly
integrate with OS keystores or hardware keys for storing the private key for
added safety. At this stage, the system could be handling very personal and
wide-ranging data, so we ensure it's trustworthy. Tools & Tech in Phase 5: If
building a custom DB in Rust, we'll use Rust's ecosystem (e.g., CRDT crates,
networking with libp2p or similar if we don't use GUN's). Mobile development
might introduce frameworks like Capacitor (to reuse web code on mobile) or a
thin native app that uses the same GUN/DB via a background service. We may also
use CI/CD tools to manage building for multiple platforms. For the AI
self-coding aspects, consider using Code LLMs (if open-source ones are available
like StarCoder, or via API GPT-4 Code). Possibly integrate with Git – the system
could even commit code suggestions to a git branch that the developer reviews.
Emphasize documentation: use Mermaid to create architecture diagrams within the
knowledge base (the system can auto-generate diagrams of its component
interactions, keeping docs in sync). The rules and FSM from Phase 4 will likely
get more complex, so we maintain diagrammatic representations (Mermaid state
diagrams) for them which can be viewed in the app. This is eating our own
dogfood: the system's documentation and design lives inside it, illustrated and
kept current. Milestones for Phase 5: Success in this final phase looks like:
The system can hold a conversation with a developer about its own design (e.g.,
"AI, how is sync implemented?" and it provides an answer citing the code or
design docs). This shows the knowledge base truly contains its self as part of
the knowledge. At least one instance of AI-generated improvement has been
applied to the project. For example, the AI might suggest an optimization or
find a bug that was then fixed. Ideally, the AI even writes a draft code which
passes tests and gets merged (with human oversight). The application (even if
not fully optimized for mobile) can be accessed on a phone or via a lightweight
web UI. This could mean we have a mobile app that syncs notes and allows queries
to the personal KB on the go. Or a web viewer that can connect to your device
via local network. Essentially, the knowledge base is ubiquitous across devices.
Community or user contributions become possible through a plugin system or
simply through the open-source repository being active. The system should have
clear guidelines for extension. All core objectives from the initial vision are
met: local-first (yes, data never required a cloud), offline-first (yes, works
offline and syncs later), distributed (yes, via P2P), AI-enhanced (yes, multiple
AI features), secure (yes, PKI and encryption throughout). With Phase 5, the
project reaches a mature state where it can continue to evolve on its own
momentum, with the user/developer community and even the AI itself contributing.
The result is a self-hosted, intelligent personal knowledge base that respects
user ownership of data and can grow in capabilities without sacrificing that
principle. Summary of Development Phases and Components The table below
